title: Could Be Harnessed For Energy
---

- Physical exertion
    - Especially in the city, there is a vast amount of kinetic energy that could be recaptured in our steps.
- Online activity
    - Imagine how much computation could be completed passively if every webpage could increment a procedural calculation.
- Lack of physical exertion
    - What if you sat eight hours a day in a chair that uses your weight to grind out frictional energy, slowing sinking over the course of the hour? Reaching the bottom each hour is a good reminder to stand up and stretch.
