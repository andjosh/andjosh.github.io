Recently, I've lead the [OfficeLuv Product Team][3] in adopting a process for recording [Architecture Decision Records][4] (ADRs).
I'll probably write more about this in the future, but the simple process of writing prose documentation about our data and system architectures has been hugely beneficial.
The work of writing down our assumptions and discarded alternatives has forced communication that doesn't always happen, even on such a small team.
And seeing several decisions laid out together begins to paint the edges of what the system handles now and what it could be shaped to handle in the future.
