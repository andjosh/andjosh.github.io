I build things for the internet and for your phones. I'm the founder of [Narro](//narro.co) and a member of [No Nonsense Agency](http://no.nonsense.agency) & [Zephyr Podcast](https://soundcloud.com/zephyrpodcast). Recently, I was VP of Engineering for [ThreadMeUp](http://threadmeup.com). I live in downtown Chicago, where I also do contract development work and provide tech advising for early-stage companies & groups. Email me if you're interested.

I respond most readily via [email(at)andjosh.com](mailto:email@andjosh.com), and sometimes check Twitter [@twandjosh](http://twitter.com/twandjosh). I often deploy repositories of knowledge and computer code to [GitHub](//github.com/andjosh). I tend to make [quite a few lists](/lists) and [write hopefully helpful things](/). If you want to know what I'm reading, you can follow through my [Narro](//narro.co) podcast: [on.narro.co/josh](http://on.narro.co/josh).

While I'm looking for my next big project, here's a bit more about me.

## What I've worked on
I have architected multi-language microservices from the ground up and migrated legacy monoliths to become agile systems. I took my last position with the express purpose of building a great engineering team and practicing my management skills. We succeeded together, and hit our goals ahead of schedule. I practice what I preach to my team, heavily involving myself in the actual code, teaching, reviewing, and writing across languages like JavaScript, Python, Go, Ruby, PHP, and Swift/Objective-C.

To make confident decisions on architecture and legacy migrations, I have to keep abreast of the industry at large. I take it as a point of pride to _not_ jump at every new framework, but I have migrated legacy code to better systems. I have worked heavily in React, Node.js, Ruby on Rails, ecommerce & payments, Flask, Django, Sinatra, Laravel, networked WordPress, Go servers, Docker and everything that connects those systems.

I have worked to build automated data ingestion, normalization, and visualization. I have built content management systems across international networks and native advertising systems with automated user tracking and feedback loops. I have built ecommerce systems, payment processing apps and automated production systems for physical goods. I have built asynchronous, event-based networked application stacks and real-time user interfaces with web-sockets.

## What I'm looking to do next
With a mastery of the languages & frameworks themselves paired with a confidence in leading actual teams, I enjoy communicating both to the rest of the company. Always one to enjoy getting my hands directly in the code, I still want to be involved in writing, reviewing, and teaching. I am looking for an opportunity to lead or build a team while also leading the code.

I would also be interested in a singular dive back into coding, maybe with a focus on Clojure, Node.js, or Go.
