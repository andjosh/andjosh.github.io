title: Supply Chain Feedback Loops in Product Development
---

General notes:

because a supply chain describes any system where:

1. There’s some demand for a final product that doesn’t exist in nature,
2. Creating that final product requires some inputs that do not exist in nature, and
3. The various inputs at stage 2 have different levels of information asymmetry, elasticity, policy/PR importance, and duration.

The bullwhip effect is the observation that a small change in demand can lead to much larger changes down the supply chain. Just like a small flick of the wrist can make a whip crack, a small change in consumer behavior is magnified at the supplier level, magnified again by their suppliers, and again down the line.

And the feedback loop of autodealerships, the sampling rate of demand paired with lead time.
