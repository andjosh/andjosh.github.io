Here are some samples of previous code I've written. Not all are recent, as I'm not using _every_ language _every_ day. I also try to list out [past and present projects](/lists/project), and usually my spare time is spent building [Narro](//www.narro.co), and it's [many services](//narro.co/apps), all of which I have written myself.

### Node.js
I wrote up a piece on the rate-limiting mechanism I wrote for Narro: [Rate Limit a Node App with MongoDB](/2016/03/13/rate-limit-node-mongodb/).

Working for [ThreadMeUp](//threadmeup.com), I wrote an automated Node.js app to dynamically determine stock levels and pricing for custom merchandising raw goods (garments and other products) among multiple suppliers which then placed automated orders via multiple API methods (FTP, SOAP, REST, XML, etc) to be delivered to multiple printing facilities across the globe, depending on capacity and ranking. It was a complicated system, but extremely valuable. [The Purchase Order class](https://gist.github.com/andjosh/99b322b7ecd6b71ea854fdccdb61eeea) was responsible for collating the needed raw goods to be ordered, then compiling comparable items (if requested), and making actionable decisions based on the criteria for ordering and delivery.

### React
Some [rendering](https://gist.github.com/andjosh/54c20cb38670d7462e901c2170c5c396) and [non-rendering](https://gist.github.com/andjosh/d4663f4622caba7d35e26e44ec9514e4) React components built for [ThreadMeUp sales page](//threadmeup.com/maximumeffort) SPAs.

### JavaScript
A heavily used library, [gatrack.js](/gatrack.js) is a tool to easily track user interactions and client-side errors in Google Analytics.

[Stark Lines](//starklines.andjosh.com): Entirely a client-side vanilla JavaScript and d3.js app, Stark Lines lets you combine real-time Google Analytics data for multiple sites/apps into one streaming graph.

[Sounds](//sounds.andjosh.com?id=narro) allows you to listen to data instead of watching it. It is a very minimalistic app, utilizing a ES6 generator framework, websockets, and the web audio JavaScript API to interpret data with audio instead of visual representations.

Others available upon [request](mailto:email@andjosh.com).

### Go
I wrote up a piece on using database connection middleware in minimalistic Go apps: [Database Middleware in Go](/2015/01/31/middleware-in-go/).

[Gopod](https://github.com/jbckmn/gopod): A podcast/RSS feed generator written in Go.

Others available upon [request](mailto:email@andjosh.com).

### Ruby
While at a previous company, I built a native-content advertising content management system and API that served across Sun-Times properties. This is [a small part of the system](https://gist.github.com/andjosh/3e2d7f684aa7903723a21107cbffcf94) I built to dynamically weight and serve the content based on rank, visibility, position placement, and more criteria.

Others available upon [request](mailto:email@andjosh.com).

### Python
A few years ago, I wrote a malleable algorithm Flask app for Aggrego that dynamically calculated a business's influence across multiple social networks. [Here are some of the basic models](https://gist.github.com/andjosh/db74d2e117ea9863f4b295f252fb5a5a).

While getting my degree in neuroscience, I spent time building machine-learning neuronal-mimicking nets to do image/pattern recognition via multiple training methods (back-propagation, etc).
