I build things for the internet and for your phones. I'm VP of Engineering for [ThreadMeUp](http://threadmeup.com) and one-half of [Team Josh](http://teamjosh.co). I live in downtown Chicago.

I respond most readily via [email(at)andjosh.com](mailto:email@andjosh.com), and sometimes check Twitter [@jbckmn](http://twitter.com/jbckmn).
