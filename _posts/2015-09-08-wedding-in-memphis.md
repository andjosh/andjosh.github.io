title: Wedding in Memphis
---
This was the first trip I can remember where I did not bring along my professional camera equipment. I don't regret it - everyone was brimming with the conversation and dancing and heat and barbecue and heat and driving and speeches and heat.

By the numbers:

- 8 hours driving in either direction
- 7 a.m. by the time we fell asleep the first night
- 6 friends
- 5 pit-stops
- 4 cups of coffee at lunch
- 3 days
- 2 beds
- 1 inflatable mattress
