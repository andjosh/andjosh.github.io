title: Recruitment Searching on GitHub
---
We're currently looking for Senior Mobile (iOS / Android) and Senior Fullstack Engineers [at OfficeLuv](//www.officeluv.com/careers). Finding great developers is...difficult. I will occasionally search for individuals on GitHub, where I can find a scrap of contact information and reach out.

[GitHub](//github.com) doesn't exactly provide a fantastic interface for perusing influential users, but it does have a [reasonably advanced search](//github.com/search/advanced). From there, you can select people using a certain language, in a certain location, and with a certain number of followers. I use the followers as [an admittedly flawed] proxy for proficiency. As an example, here's [my search for influential JavaScript developers in Chicagoland](https://github.com/search?utf8=âœ“&q=location%3AChicago+location%3AIL+followers%3A%3E15+language%3AJavaScript&type=Users&ref=searchresults). If you take a look at the search terms, you can see where to tweak/replace the chosen language, alter the lower-bound of followers, or change the location. Use it to find some good employees.
