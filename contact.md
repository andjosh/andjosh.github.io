_If you want to talk software or product/engineering teams, I want to talk to you._

I like reading things. If you write something worth reading, please tell me.

My email addresses are josh@ any domain I control, including this one. My handle on most social networks and IM platforms is andjosh (e.g. [@andjosh](//github.com/andjosh) on Github, [@andjosh_](//twitter.com/andjosh_) on Twitter, etc.). I strongly prefer email as a communication method. 

I want to hear from you. I hope you reach out.

You can [book time to meet](//calendly.com/andjosh/30min) and we'll become great friends.
