In product research, people sometimes make the mistake of ‘validating’ their product idea by interviewing customers and describing the most generic version of their product. The customer already has a problem, so a product generic enough to solve all their problems sounds wonderful and they want that. But once you get down to building specifics and you haven’t solved all the problems right away, they won’t switch away from the incumbent solution because it doesn’t solve one of their problems better.   
Software engineers are a similar way, in that they consider new technology often in generic terms and use cases. Oh that new tech idea? It’s better than everything you’ve been doing. Let’s adopt it everywhere. It’s the new best pattern. Then you get down to specifics of usage and the engineers have built terrible patterns of specifics off a promised generic that doesn’t exist.
