> Many people read paragraph by paragraph, sounding out a text, like a child reading letter by letter or word by word. The next level, which many do not reach, is to grasp a book all at once, in its entirety.

> \[...\] It’s like examining a mural from two centimeters away and scanning it ten centimeters at a time, like a short-sighted slug. This doesn’t allow for the integration of the whole, for taking in the mural at a glance.

> \[...\] And how many people want to feel like slugs, especially once they know what it is like to express themselves intelligently in conversation? This accentuates the difference between the developed oral side and the underdeveloped written side. People who feel this way don’t read books. They never really learned how to read books. 

> the cost of reading would be much reduced if more authors respected the readers’ time and published less. 

> People want to be at the center of the world’s stage and conversation, but the world’s conversations are myriad and continue you’d and concurrent. The true art of publishing involves placing the text in the middle of a conversation, adding to it, knowing how to feed the flames. 

> With more education, more and more people want to be published. More want to be published than want to read. “I need you to hear me, more than I need to hear you.” \[...\] Not even poets wan to read poetry, unless they are required to do so in order to see their own work published. 

> Books are published faster than ever. More is being published every day than you could ever read. \[...\] Your ignorance grows faster than your knowledge.
