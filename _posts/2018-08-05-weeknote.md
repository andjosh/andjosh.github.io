I’m currently spending time each week interviewing people for our open software engineer position at OfficeLuv. Most days I’m just searching for candidates, and whenever I do find someone I want to interview (I had 5 interviews on Tuesday), I need to make the questions count.

One focus I’ve found to be quick and a reliable way to judge capability is to ask candidates about the second-order effects of their work. Most of the young developers I meet consider only the immediate effects of their solution or immediate problems they debug. The best ones first extrapolate their solution before implementing it. I’m not condoning analysis-paralysis or premature optimization, just the ability to consider a level above or below the current situation.

- How does changing this interface affect user behavior? How will that cascade into stressing pathways within the application queues?
- How does optimizing this function for speed over consistency guide user behavior?

Often, I’ll ask a technical question later in the interview process. It’s not entirely important that they can readily rattle off the underlying algorithm; I’ll happily go over the technical implementation with them. The important part is the second part of the question, where we talk about which and *why* certain pitfalls, benefits, and behaviors happen because of that implementation.

Because of this, I’ve had second-order thinking on my mind all week. Here are just good pieces and thoughts I’ve found just this week that fit that theme.

[This Mind-Controlled Robotic Limb Lets You Multitask With Three Arms](https://singularityhub.com/2018/07/31/this-prosthesis-lets-you-multitask-with-three-arms/amp/)
It turns out that even when subjects lost the third arm, their rapid task-switching skills remained improved. How much more of our brain is constrained because of physical limitations through the rest of our body?

[Disturbances #16: The Price of Perfection](https://tinyletter.com/hautepop/letters/disturbances-16-the-price-of-perfection)
This person writes a newsletter every week about dust and I’ve subscribed for a while. It’s usually pretty fantastic. This week, they wrote about the accumulation of dust as a result of modern technological manufacturing. As it turns out, accumulations of dust can be explosive.

[Should computer science researches disclose negative side-effects?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17679018)
There was a publication this week of an idea: software engineers should disclose the possible bad-actor uses and second-order effects of the software they research and/or develop. I *completely* agree with an initiative like this. I was surprised to see so many engineers trying to argue their inability to even attempt such thinking.

[Cryptocurrency mining operators are clustering around low-priced renewable energy sources](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/bitcoin-mining-energy-consumption-new-york)
Energy-guzzling software is clumping together in geographic space where energy costs less.

I change the placement and structure of my desk at work pretty often. Here is my current work desk. Not pictured: this is at a standing bar table.
