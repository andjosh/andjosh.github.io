These are people, sites, newsletters, or channels that I've been reading for months or years and would whole-heartedly recommend to you over a drink.

I've randomized the order, so don't read into who or what is listed first.

<hr/>

{% assign n = site.blogroll | size %}
{% assign links = site.blogroll | sample: n %}
{% for link in links %}
  <p>
    <a href="{{ link.url }}" rel="nofollow">{{ link.title }}</a>
  </p>
{% endfor %}
