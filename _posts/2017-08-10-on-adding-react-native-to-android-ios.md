title: On Adding React Native to Existing iOS and Android Apps

No homework for me today. I woke up and integrated new [React Native][0] code into an existing [Swift 3][1] iOS app.

I spent 5 hours getting the bare dependencies to compile React components into the existing app codebase, then 3 hours building an interface in React that would have taken a day in native iOS. I was also able to copy and paste our existing JavaScript business logic libraries with zero problem. It felt as if I spent all morning painfully biking up a mountain, after which I'm now coasting downhill.

Tomorrow is biking up the mountain to integrate React Native into our Android app. Luckily I have [Nevzat][2] to help with that.

I will write up all of this once a full release cycle is complete.
