I work as a software engineer at a big eCommerce company now - self-taught through years of mistakes, skepticism, and many other jobs.

I write about topics related to software engineering and the things I’ve read in lots of different places.

If I know you as a friend or family, I’ll mostly send you life updates and photos I take from time to time.

You can view some past editions <a href="https://buttondown.email/andjosh/archive">in the archive</a>.
