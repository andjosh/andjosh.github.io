I'm the founder of <a href="//narro.co">Narro</a>, the best way to listen to the Internet. I'm currently leading the product & engineering team at <a href="//officeluv.com">OfficeLuv</a>. I'm also a member of the <a href="http://no.nonsense.agency">No Nonsense Agency</a>.

I built the engineering team and product at [ThreadMeUp](//threadmeup.com) from a team of 4 to over 30.

Before that, I was the first engineering hire at [Aggrego](//aggrego.com), a kind of startup incubator.

And before that, I used to be a photojournalist, an EMT, and a construction worker. I studied Neuroscience and machine learning at the University of Illinois.

You can [book time to meet](//calendly.com/andjosh/30min) and we'll become great friends.

I respond most readily via [email(at)andjosh.com](mailto:email@andjosh.com), and Twitter [@andjosh_](//twitter.com/andjosh_).

I often deploy repositories of knowledge and computer code to [GitHub](//github.com/andjosh). I tend to make [quite a few lists](/lists) and [write hopefully helpful things](/). I'm open to advising [on AngelList](//angel.co/andjosh).

If you want to know what I'm reading, you can follow through my [Narro](//narro.co) podcast: [narro.co/playable/josh](//www.narro.co/playable/josh).
