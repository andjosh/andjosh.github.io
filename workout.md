This workout schedule is wrung out of a dozen others, and was geared toward my goal of strength gains. It will, however be suitable for most young adults.

Before beginning, go through the "lead" exercises from each day. For each, using the heaviest weight you can manage, perform 5-9 reps. Use this result in the "weight" and "reps" fields. These values will be used to calculate your maximum capacity (one rep max) and the weekly weight plans.

Each exercise below, except where delegated by the table, has an assigned number of reps. Each should be done with the maximum weight that still allows you to complete the reps.

After four weeks, add 5–10% to your maxes (multiply the "weight" by 1.1), save, and repeat the cycle.

Alternatively, I have a [bodyweight-only workout](/workout-bodyweight/#combinations) structure.
