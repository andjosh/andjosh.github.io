You should use your metrics fro more than reporting. Use them to inform actions, then write systems to take those actions on your behalf, automatically.
If you're just going to look at some number and change another number, have a computer do it for you.
We do this with Appsignal's API. We collect performance metrics and then scale based on those metrics. Lots of companies do that on a very basic scale, with utilization metrics. But we scale at the function and RPC level. Then we can extrapolate to scale and react based on the data involved.
