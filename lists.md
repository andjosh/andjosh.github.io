I grew up in a family that makes lists. [Every. Day.](/images/page/list.jpg)

Now, I've started keeping lists not only of things I'm currently thinking about or working on, but also lists to remind me of the past and lists to remind of that which I wish to do.

- [Reading Lists](/lists/reading)
- [Project Lists](/lists/project)
- [Podcast Lists](/lists/podcast)
- [Newsletter Lists](/lists/newsletter)
- [Camera Lists](/lists/camera)
- [Motorcycle Lists](/lists/motorcycle)
- [People I Don't Know but Admire Lists](/lists/people-i-admire)
- [Employment Lists](/lists/employment)
- [Location Lists](/lists/location)
- [Movie/Show Lists](/lists/movie-show)

Partly inspired by [Max Fenton](http://maxfenton.com/biblio/).

### Newsletter
Once I started putting these lists online, I started a newsletter to share ones smaller, funnier, larger, etc.
