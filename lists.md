I grew up in a family that makes lists.

[Every. Day.](/images/page/list.jpg)

Now, I've started keeping lists not only of things I'm currently thinking about or working on, but also lists to remind me of the past and lists to remind of that which I wish to do.

- [Employment Lists](/employment-lists)
- [Location Lists](/location-lists)

Partly inspired by [Max Fenton](http://maxfenton.com/biblio/).

### Newsletter
Once I started putting these lists online, I started a newsletter to share ones smaller, funnier, larger, etc.
