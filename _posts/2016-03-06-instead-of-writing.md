A list of things I did yesterday _instead_ of writing a thoughtful piece here:

- Built [Five For Founders](http://fives.andjosh.com)
- Redesigned the [apps & integrations page on Narro](//www.narro.co/apps)
- Imagined, built, and ultimately discarded a [new, grid-like home page for this site](/grid)
- Imagined and made plans for hacking a Roomba to do...nothing useful
- Watched numerous videos explaining the Russian martial art of [Sambo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sambo_(martial_art))
- Explored and ultimately ditched changes to typography on Narro and this site
- Felt bad about not writing anything useful here
