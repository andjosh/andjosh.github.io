title: The Electrician

At our office, we have desks for everyone. We have multiple televisions, each with an Apple TV. We have high ceilings and handmade wooden meeting tables. We have walls covered in chalkboard paint and walls covered in dry-erase paint.

Breakfast is catered each morning and there is hot water on tap for tea. There are wireless speakers for playing background music and a tiny chandelier. We have sofas and coffee tables and space to play catch with racquet balls.

Just the other day, an electrician was working on our floor. He was installing new outlets beneath our stainless steel counter-top with his partner. I talked to him a bit, and he was good to speak with.

He was mainly surprised by one thing.
