If you want the latest as I publish things, the best way to subscribe is through the [RSS feed](/rss.xml) for this site.

I send a monthly-ish newsletter about things interesting to people thinking about or working in tech and teams.

<form
  action="https://buttondown.email/api/emails/embed-subscribe/andjosh"
  method="post"
  target="popupwindow"
  onsubmit="window.open('https://buttondown.email/andjosh', 'popupwindow')"
  class="embeddable-buttondown-form"
>
  <label for="bd-email">Enter your email:</label>
  <input type="email" name="email" id="bd-email">
  <input type="hidden" value="1" name="embed"/>
  <input type="submit" value="Subscribe" />
</form>

You can view some past editions <a href="https://buttondown.email/andjosh/archive">in the archive</a>.
