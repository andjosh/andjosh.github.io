- Make a list
- Why I don't mind changing my website so often
- My current podcast list
- my current newsletter list
- what if you have to earn the ability to 'like' something on a site? Like, you have to view is 5 times and then the option presents itself. That imbues a lot more meaning. Like Fish: A Tap Essay.
- You can work out drunk or on creatine. Same thing.
- Web dev is just too young. To recognize its own Freuds and outdated theorists.
- Write about looking for condos and the permanence it evokes. Helen who has lived in her building for thirty years. Us looking for a place for five or ten years.
