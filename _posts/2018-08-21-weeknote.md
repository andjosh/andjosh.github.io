On repeat: [Joe Goddard - Electric Lines](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRzkF-IeOX8)

I was dramatically sick Tuesday and Wednesday of last week; I’m guessing food poisoning. The combination of not eating, not exercising, barely drinking, and barely standing made me lose over 10 pounds in about a day. The following day, the dehydration caused me to cramp up so badly I nearly went to the urgent care. There are some patterns you just shouldn't break.

Collect more than one person in a place and they will start patterning themselves off each other. You can see it in [Instagram on repeat, on repeat](https://www.instagram.com/insta_repeat/). All these influencers seem to be "influencing" in the same direction.

Intermittently breaking pattern and secluding yourself from an environment of repeated interaction [statistically leads to more thoughtful and novel responses](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1029124892439072768.html). It improves the group’s collective intelligence, too.

In recent weeks, I’ve been spending a fair amount of time condensing a service-oriented application architecture down to a queue-based implementation within a single project. I’m notoriously a proponent for pervasive patterns in the code I write. I will often go back a rewrite groups of functions to match the same signature or reorganize class hierarchies to fit a couple new members. The real benefits are realized and strengthened now as I go through years-old code, transposing high-level tasks in one language to another. Each revision chips away a few more bits from the edges to reveal the best pattern beneath.
