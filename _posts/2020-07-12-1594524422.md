I would really love to see programmers/maintainers of influential libraries, frameworks, and languages (Redux, SwiftUI, Erlang, etc.) begin to describe their [Theory Building][0] as top-level documentation in the source code.
I think several maintainers do good work to educate everyone with conference talks and blog posts (Rich Hickey, Dan Abramov, etc.), but documentation with the project would be amazing as an introduction with the codebase.
